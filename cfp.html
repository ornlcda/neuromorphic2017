         <!-- <p class="lead">Call for papers will be available on February 28, 2017.</p>-->

		With the looming end of the “Moore’s Law” era, there is an emerging challenge to “<a href="http://www.nano.gov/grandchallenges">proactively interpret and learn from data, solve unfamiliar problems using what it has learned, and operate with the energy efficiency of the human brain</a>."
          </p>
        <p class="lead">
        We believe neuromorphic computing will play a major role in this challenge, and has the potential to transform the way we use computers through new materials, new brain-inspired chips, greater understanding of neuroscience, and breakthroughs in machine understanding/intelligence. Neuromorphic computing systems have the potential to mimic the functionality of neural systems in the brain, which we believe will lead to more powerful and efficient computing paradigms. These new systems have the potential to help scientists pioneer new scientific discoveries, or to help intelligently analyze sensor data for improved cyber security or energy management.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
        The goal of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers in neuromorphic computing to present new research, develop new collaborations, and provide a forum to publish work in this area. Our focus will be on architectures, models, and applications of neuromorphic systems, resulting from a very successful workshop last year.
        </p>
         <h3 class="topics-header">Research papers are requested for topics on Neuromorphic Computing. There are three focus areas, though papers outside the scope of these areas but within Neuromorphic Computing will be considered: </h3>
                    <ol class="topics-list">
            <li><b>Architectures, Models, and Emulation</b>: including network, neuron, and synapse models, emerging hardware implementations, and efficient simulation techniques for large-scale networks
</li>
			<li><b>Machine intelligence algorithms for programming or training neuromorphic devices</b>: including supervised and unsupervised learning methods and biologically-inspired algorithms. 
			</li>
			<li><b>Applications for and use-cases of neuromorphic systems</b>,  including those where neuromorphic systems have the potential to outperform state-of-the-art techniques.  This topic area also includes supporting software systems that enable application development for neuromorphic systems and suggestions for benchmark tasks for neuromorphic computing. 
			</li>
          </ol>
                   <h3 class="topics-header">We are accepting submissions in the following forms:</h3>

                   <ol class="topics-list">
                   <li> Full papers (6-8 pages), which will be considered for full (20 minute) presentations. </li>
                   <li> Extended abstracts (1-2 pages) for lightning talks and/or poster presentations.</li>
                   </ol>
                  
                   
                   <p class="lead">
                   Select papers will be invited to submit extended versions for a special issue of the ACM Journal of Emerging Technologies (JETC).

The White House has announced a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/10/15/nanotechnology-inspired-grand-challenge-future-computing">Nanotechnology-Inspired Grand Challenge for Future Computing</a>, 
which seeks to create a new type of computer that can “proactively interpret and learn from data, solve unfamiliar problems using what it has learned, and operate with the energy efficiency of the human brain.” This grand challenge is meant to leverage and synergize three of our national research and development initiatives: National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI), and the BRAIN initiative.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">

The goal of this workshop is to define basic research challenges for neuromorphic computing research from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) perspective. Our focus is to define a 10-20 year roadmap for neuromorphic computing that leverages the strengths and capabilities of the DOE National Laboratory system.
          </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                    We invite you to submit a two-page white paper to our upcoming Neuromorphic Computing workshop. White paper submission deadline is April 8, 2016.
          </p>
          <h3 class="topics-header">Research white papers are requested in three Neuromorphic Computing focused areas:  </h3>

          <p>
White paper Submissions must clearly identify the workshop attendee and include the following information: White paper Title, Name, Email, Organization, Focused Area (1–3, above) and Narrative (in Word or PDF format only). The submission is via the workshop website. Questions can be addressed to Dr. Thomas Potok, Dr. Catherine Schuman, Dr. Robert Patton, Dr. Todd Hylton, Dr. Helen Li, and Dr. Robinson Pino. Dr. Thomas Potok will serve as the General Workshop Chair. We look forward to your submission.
